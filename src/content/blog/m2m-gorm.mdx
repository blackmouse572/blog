## What is Many to Many relation ?
A _many-to-many relationship_ occurs when multiple records in a table are associated with multiple records in another table. For example, a many-to-many relationship exists between customers and products: customers can purchase various products, and products can be purchased by many customers.

## How Many to Many display in SQL database ?
Relational database systems usually don't allow you to implement a direct many-to-many relationship between two tables. Consider the example of keeping track of invoices. If there were many invoices with the same invoice number and one of your customers inquired about that invoice number, you wouldn't know which number they were referring to. This is one reason for assigning a unique value to each invoice.

To avoid this problem, you can break the many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many relationships by using a third table, called a _join table_. Each record in a join table includes a match field that contains the value of the primary keys of the two tables it joins. (In the join table, these match fields are foreign keys.) These foreign key fields are populated with data as records in the join table are created from either table it joins.

A typical example of a many-to many relationship is one between students and classes. A student can register for many classes, and a class can include many students.

The following example includes a Students table, which contains a record for each student, and a Classes table, which contains a record for each class. A join table, Enrollments, creates two one-to-many relationships—one between each of the two tables.

## Defined M-M in GORM
In this article, i will lead you how to create a many to many relation and its uses. The base setup of GORM in Go will not be talk here. But free to look at the document if you need so.

### Defined model
First, let's understand what are we gonna build

<strong>Business Rule:</strong> A movies manager. User can get a movie and it will show all the actors of that movie.
- A table of `Movie`
- A table of `Actor`

A Movie can have many Actors
An Actor can be inside many Movies
=> This is a many to many relation

<strong>Approach:</strong> We will have a third table `filmography` to contain which Actor act in which Movie.

![Many to Many Movie](/images/m2m-gorm/movie.png)
Now, we will reflect that inside our code
```go title="models/movie.go"
import (
	"database/sql"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

type Movie struct {
	gorm.Model
	Name string
	Description string
	ReleaseDt time.Time
}

type Actor struct {
	gorm.Model
	Fullname string
	Gender string
}

type Filmography struct {
	gorm.Model
	MovieID int
	ActorID int
}
```

And don't forget to add it on `AutoMigrate`

```go title="db.go"
// ...rest code
err := db.AutoMigrate(
	&models.Movie
	&models.Actor
	&models.Filmography
)
// ...rest code
```

### Get a movie at its actors
<strong>User story:</strong> As a user, I would like a see "Avengers Infinity War" and its Actors so that I can know if Steve Roger is acted by whom

So, as the story tell, we need to query the move where its name is "Avengers Infinity War", then join the actor table to return all the value of its.

```go title="handlers/movie.go"
func GetMovieActors(name string) []Actor {
	var movie Movie
	db.Where("name = ?", name).First(&movie)
	var filmography []Filmography
	db.Where("movie_id = ?", movie.ID).fint(&filmography)

	var actor_ids []int
	for _, film := range filmography {
		actor_ids = append(actor_ids, element.ActorID)
	}

	var actors []Actor
	db.Where("id IN ?", actor_ids).Find(&actors)

	return actors
}
```

### Refactor using GORM relations
As the previous code has a good based, however, it bring too many boilerplate code. Luckily GORM have provided some api to make this easier and cleaner to work with

Let re-defined the model
```go title="models/movie.go"
import (
	"database/sql"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

type Movie struct {
	gorm.Model
	Name string
	Description string
	ReleaseDt time.Time

	Actors []Actor `gorm:"many2many:filmography;"` // [!code ++]
}

type Actor struct {
	gorm.Model
	Fullname string
	Gender string
}

type Filmography struct { // [!code --]
	gorm.Model // [!code --]
	MovieID int // [!code --]
	ActorID int // [!code --]
} // [!code --]
```

We have add the property `Actors` for our `Movie` struct. With `gorm:"many2many:filmography;"` we let the GORM know that
- Actor and Movie have many to many relation
- And make a third table called filmography to hold that relation
As the result. We no longer need `Filmography` struct as well as in AutoMigrate

```go title="db.go"
// ...rest code
err := db.AutoMigrate(
	&models.Movie
	&models.Actor
	&models.Filmography // [!code --]
)
// ...rest code
```

Now, let refactor the handler to apply new schema we just created

```go title="handlers/movie.go"
func GetMovieActors(name string) []Actor {
	var movie Movie
	db.Where("name = ?", name).Preload("Actors").First(&movie)

	return movie.Actors
}
```
